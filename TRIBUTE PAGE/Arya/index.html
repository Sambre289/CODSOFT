        <p>&#9752 <b>Jehangir Bhabha</b> (1909–1966) was an Indian nuclear physicist who is considered the father of the
          Indian nuclear program. He played a crucial role in the development of nuclear science and technology in
          India.
          Here is a detailed overview of his life and contributions:
          <br><br>

          &#9752 <b>Early Life and Education :</b> <br>

          &#8594 Cosmic Ray Research: Bhabha is renowned for his work on cosmic rays. He conducted groundbreaking
          research
          that led to the understanding of the properties of these high-energy particles.<br>s
          &#8594 Bhabha Scattering: One of his significant contributions is the theoretical explanation of
          electron-positron scattering, which is now known as Bhabha scattering.
          <br><br>

          &#9752 <b>Career and Achievements :</b><br>
          &#8594 Return to India: In 1939, he returned to India due to the outbreak of World War II. He joined the
          Indian Institute of Science
          in Bangalore, where he worked with Nobel laureate C.V. Raman.<br>
          &#8594 Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR): In 1945, he founded TIFR in Bombay, which became the
          center of nuclear research in India.
          &#8594 Atomic Energy Commission: Appointed as the first chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission in
          1948.
          He played a pivotal role informulating India’s nuclear policy and spearheading its atomic energy program.
          <br><br>

          &#9752 <b>International Contributions :</b><br>
          &#8594 International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA): Bhabha was instrumental in the formation of the IAEA and was
          elected as the President of the United Nations Conference
          on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in 1955.<br>
          &#8594 Awards and Honors: He received several prestigious awards, including the Padma Bhushan in 1954. He was
          also elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society
          <br><br>

          &#9752 <b>Legacy :</b><br>
          &#8594 Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC): In his honor, the Atomic Energy Establishment, Trombay was
          renamed as Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) after his death.<br>
          &#8594 Inspiration: Bhabha’s vision and contributions have left a lasting impact on India’s scientific
          community and its nuclear energy program,
          paving the way for advancements in science and technology in the country.<br>
